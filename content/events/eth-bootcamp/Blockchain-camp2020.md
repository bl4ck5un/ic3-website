## REGISTRATION

We will offer two overlapping tracks: a presentation track and a coding track.

Option 1: The **coding track** includes all presentations, virtual social activities, and participation in a weeklong coding project on a 5 - 10 person team. This is limited to IC3 sponsors, faculty, staff, and students. In the coding track, you can expect to engage with leaders in the blockchain community - faculty, architects, developers, and students.

Option 2: The **presentation track** will be open to the public with many of the daily talks and panels the participants in the coding track join. 

For registration in either track, <a href="https://forms.gle/GQn7GrDBQST7LHZb8">please apply here</a>.
