The High School Programming Contest Warm Up is the precursor to the High School Programming Contest, aimed at helping underrepresented groups in technology learn more about programming and hone their skills. The students are given two hours to solve eight programming problems ranging in difficulty, teams are awarded points based on the time it took to complete the problem and the level of difficulty. This year's event was attended by 135 students from 10 different states, the teams were composed of both pairs and trios. The winning team Doral TreeSum was from Doral Academy in Florida. 

The event was organized by Robbert Van Renesse (IC3 Faculty) and Diane Levitt (Cornell Tech), which also featured 30 mentors composed of students from Cornell and Cornell Tech. The mentors were there to assist with the mundane programming details that frequently come up when solving programming problems. The mentors weren't there to give answers, instead they were there to help the students on troubleshooting the problems and looking at them in a different way. The competition was aimed more at process of coding than the competition aspect, the goal of the event was to help young coders gain confidence and skills to help encourage them to continue coding.

IC3 was proud to sponsor this event as it is one of our goals to create a more inclusive space in programming.
