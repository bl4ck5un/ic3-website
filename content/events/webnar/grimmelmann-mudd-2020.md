**ABSTRACT**

Blockchains seem to replace the muddiness of human institutions with the crystalline mathematical perfection of code. But some of this shift is an illusion: the mud always finds a way to seep back in. I will give a lawyer's perspective on why ambiguity and discretion are so hard to get rid of, even on blockchains.
