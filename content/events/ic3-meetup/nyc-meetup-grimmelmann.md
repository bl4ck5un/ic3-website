Smart contracts are written in programming languages rather than in natural language. Smart contract fans sometimes argue that this gives them an advantage because natural languages are often ambiguous. Using a programming language insulates smart contracts from disagreements and confusion about what crucial terms mean. The behavior of a program depends only on technical facts, not on social ones.

This argument is wrong. Programs can be ambiguous too because technical facts depend on social ones. A program's meaning comes from a community of programmers and users who have agreed on the semantics of a programming language. This is a social process. Some famous controversies involving blockchains and smart contracts show that they regularly run into serious ambiguities. In the most famous case, The DAO hack, more than $150 million in virtual currency turned on the contested semantics of a blockchain-based smart-contract programming language. 


**Agenda**

*6:00 PM* - Doors open

*6:45 PM* - Introduction to Arbitrum and off-chain computations by Ed Felten

*7:00 PM* - Q&A with Ed Felten

*7:15 PM* - All Smart Contracts Are Ambiguous with James Grimmelmann

*8:15 PM* - Networking with food and drinks


**Speakers**

Ed Felten - Off-Chain Labs (Co-Founder)

Ed Felten is the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. He formerly served in the White House as Deputy United States Chief Technology Officer. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and co-author of the leading textbook on cryptocurrencies. 

James Grimmelmann - Cornell Tech (Professor of Law)

James Grimmelmann studies how laws regulating software affect freedom, wealth, and power. As a lawyer and technologist, he helps these two groups understand each other by writing about copyright and digitization, the regulation of search engines, privacy on social networks, and other topics in computer and Internet law. 


**Host**

Sarah Allen - IC3 (Community Manager)

Sarah Allen is the IC3 Community Manager, supporting interactions among faculty, students, and industry partners; and spreading the IC3 word throughout the greater community. She has a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Michigan and previous experience in academic research. 


**Chainlink**

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. Chainlink is consistently selected as one of the top blockchain technologies by leading independent research firms such as Gartner. It is well known for providing highly secure and reliable oracles to both large enterprises (SWIFT Google, Oracle) and leading smart contract development teams. 


**Arbitrum**

We make smart contracts easier and cheaper to develop and run at a massive scale, with production-level security. Our developer tools do the heavy lifting to add a flexible second layer to your decentralized application architecture so that you can focus on business logic and user experience. Beginning with the Ethereum blockchain, we're coming soon to a blockchain near you.
