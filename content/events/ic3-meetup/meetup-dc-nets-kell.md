**Abstract**: Anonymous communiication is important for dissidents, activists, whistleblowers, journalists, and any individuals that might be under surveillance by other parties. Dining Cryptographer Networks (DC-Nets) provide the strongest anonymity protections and the lowest possible latency of any current cryptographic solution. Unfortunately DC-Nets are faced with three fatal flaws that prevent their deployment in the real world: prohibitive bandwidth consumption, denial of service attacks (DoS) by participants, and low fault tolerance. In this talk, I will discuss DC Nets and how they work, and then present Howl, our new open source project and decentralized anonymity network that solves these issues to make DC-Nets usable in the real world. We leverage a new aggregation protocol for bandwidth and fault tolerance issues, and use trusted execution environments (TEEs) to prevent DoS. All privacy is handled by the DC-net protocol and at no point does broadcast privacy rely on the trusted execution environment or aggregation network.

**Registration**: Advance regstration is required for access to Cornell Tech. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfclGpVK0D5do-RGM_yb30eiX7ooBqThKFge4mY362GKIiynQ/viewform">register here</a>.
